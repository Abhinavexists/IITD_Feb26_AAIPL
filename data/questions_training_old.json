        "answer":"{'topic': 'Mixed Series (Alphanumeric)', 'question': 'Identify the missing term in the following series: A1, C4, F9, J16, O25, U36, ?', 'choices': ['A) B49', 'B) Y49', 'C) Z49', 'D) A49'], 'answer': 'A', 'explanation': 'Numbers are successive squares: 1\u00b2,\\u202f2\u00b2,\\u202f3\u00b2,\\u202f4\u00b2,\\u202f5\u00b2,\\u202f6\u00b2 \u2026 so the next is 7\u00b2 = 49. The letters advance by the same amount as the square root of the preceding number: A\u2192(+2)C\u2192(+3)F\u2192(+4)J\u2192(+5)O\u2192(+6)U. Adding 7 to U (21st letter) gives 28; wrapping past Z (26) yields the 2nd letter, B. Hence the term is B49.'}"
